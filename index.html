      <article>
        <p>In recent years, AI technology has advanced rapidly, leading to numerous breakthroughs in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. However, there are growing concerns among tech experts about the potential risks of continuing to train AI models, particularly when it comes to issues such as privacy, bias, and fairness.</p>
          
        <p>As a result, a growing number of tech experts are advocating for a halt in AI training until these issues can be addressed. Many argue that current AI models have the potential to reinforce existing biases and discrimination, perpetuating social inequalities in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice. Additionally, there are concerns that AI models could be used to invade people's privacy, as well as to manipulate public opinion or engage in other forms of unethical behavior.</p>

        <p>Advocates for a halt in AI training are calling on policymakers, industry leaders, and tech experts to take a more proactive approach to these issues. They argue that AI development should be guided by ethical principles and should prioritize the interests of society as a whole, rather than individual companies or governments.</p>

        <p>Despite these concerns, some industry leaders are pushing ahead with AI development, arguing that the potential benefits outweigh the risks. They point to the potential for AI to improve healthcare outcomes, accelerate scientific research, and drive economic growth.</p>

        <p>However, as the debate over AI continues to unfold, it is clear that there is a growing need for more transparency, accountability, and ethical oversight in the development of these technologies. Whether a halt in AI training is necessary remains to be seen, but it is clear that the risks of unchecked AI development must be addressed if we are to realize the full potential of these technologies while also protecting the interests of society.</p>

But AI technologies can have negative, even catastrophic, effects if they are used without sufficient regard to how they affect people’s human rights,” - Michelle Bachelet Jeria.
